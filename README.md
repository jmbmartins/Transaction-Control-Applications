# Transaction Control Applications Repository

This repository contains applications developed as part of a practical work assignment focusing on transaction control in the context of database management systems. The applications included are:

- **Application1_Edit**: Allows users to edit and update order information.
- **Application2_Browser**: Provides a browsing interface for viewing orders and their details.
- **Application3_LogTempo**: Displays logs of specific events related to order editing.
- **Application4_Log**: Shows the most recent log entries for specific events.

Additionally, the script `DoWorkSQL.sql` is used for testing concurrent transactions and the detailed report `Relatorio_SGBD_Transacoes.pdf` explaines the work done.
